PySims Library
==============

Mission
-------

A Python library to read in data files from The Sims™.
The Sims™ is a trademark of Maxis and Electronic Arts.

PySims is based on SimTech Library and the thorough documentation of
the file formats involved in The Sims™ done by Dave Baum, Greg Noel, 
Peter Gould and others. The docs are available at

    http://simtech.sourceforge.net/home/welcome.html

Requirements
------------

 *Python 3.4 or above
 *The original The Sims™ for test data (not required to use the lib)
 
Installation
------------

To use the original The Sims™ game data, copy the two data folders

    GameData
    UserData2

into a folder called '''TheSims_official_gamedata'''. Now you can run the tests for the library.
You should find those folders in your The Sims™ installation on your hard drive.
